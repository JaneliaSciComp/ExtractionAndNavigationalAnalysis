This directory contains files for managing Matlab source code and binaries for
the Larval Olympiad Extraction and Navigational Analysis pipeline.

But to date (12/17/2013) it is not fully implemented.  This is an intentional
choice, since making this operational is currently a relatively low priority.

In principle it should be capable of downloading the latest samuellab source code,
checking to see whether code changes have been applied, and rebuilding all the binaries
[ recommendation: change them all at once, irrespective of whether only a few binaries
have been affected ].  Or perhaps it would be more prudent just to warn the relevant folks
if recent source code changes might merit rebuilding the binaries.


Unfortunately, the github-checkout (tarball) mechanism used here doesn't preserve
timestamps, which makes it more difficult to make informed decisions regarding
whether a software rebuild is justified.


Here are the current files:
* fdep_21jun2010.zip - a third-party dependency analysis tool for Matlab.  The canonical
  "depfun" function requires the Control Toolbox, but this solution requires no
  toolboxes
* doSamuelLabGithubCheckout.sh - as indicated, it fetches the source code.
* myMatlabBuildAll.sh - build all 6 of the currently required Matlab binaries.   Some paths probably
  need to be updated for this to work properly
* myMatlabSampleFdep - a sample run of "fdep" to calculate dependencies.  This needs
  to be extended for all (6?) binaries (in a single concatenated output), and
  then the output post-processed to a list of filenames.  This filename list can
  then be used to determine whether any key files have changed, for example by
  using a small Python script and the Unix "cmp -s" command.
* samuellab-Matlab-Track-Analysis.tar.gz - a source code baseline.  This should be updated
  in Subversion (either automatically or manually) at the same time that the Matlab
  binaries are updated


Note that the Matlab binaries themselves reside elsewhere in the Subversion tree, in:
  ../settings/current.   If they are to be updated (either manually or automatically) at
some point in the future, the updates must be performed in that directory, not here.
